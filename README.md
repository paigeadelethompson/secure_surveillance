# Shelved 
this was a very successful experimeent though it could stand to be re-written. A similar build of Void Linux was made for the uConsole in light of this project, and it can be found here: https://github.com/Ravenhammer-Research/void-uconsole

# Secure Surveillance System 
Based around Raspberry Pi 3/4/5 / EasyCap USB. 

Equipment list: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/50G0MY6VFOCH?ref_=wl_share

This list is fairly curated but you're welcome to shop around. This is a recipe for probably the best kind of surveillance system you can get and it will work well, but there are some things worth understanding about it which could be a nightmare for certain people. In a pinch I could support this for a client no problem. Admittedly there's a lot to be said for low voltage tech and just making Linux work correctly and it's not always trivial. This is here for anybody 
that can appreciate it, with no gurantees except for what you can gurantee yourself.

This operating system image is produced entirely using a Github Workflow, if I can't maintain this then surely somebody else can.

## Installation (Raspi)

- Download zip from releases page; minimum ~8GB micro SDHC card required
- `dd if=installer.bin of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M status=progress`

### Extend the storage / home directory partition (Use as large of an SD card as you want)
- Edit the card with parted, delete partition 3 and recreate it with the desired extents, specify that it is an NTFS partition.
- Do not format this partition, once the partition table is recreated simply mount the partition as if it were already formatted to test:
  
```

```

This partition is exfat (FAT64) and is accessible from Windows and MacOS computers. Unlike FAT32, ExFAT is not limited to 32GB, which ultimately will be ideal for video recording and retention. One other caveat is that ExFAT like FAT32 has a very rudimentary file attribute label, so to work around this the filesystem is
mounted with virtual attributes by the OS at boot:

```
/dev/mmcblk0p3 /home/pi exfat defaults,nofail,uid=4000,gid=5000,dmask=007,fmask=117 0 0
```

And all services which need read/write access to the storage FS are to be a member of the `pi` group. 

# Testing with QEmu 

- Get the kernel 

```
losetup -P /dev/loop254 installer.bin
mount /dev/loop254p1 /mnt
mkdir krn/ ; cp /mnt/* krn/
umount /mnt
losetup -D /dev/loop254
```

- Start QEmu 

```

# Configuration
Network configuration can be specified in cmdline.txt:

```
ip=192.168.180.120:192.168.180.100:192.168.180.1:255.255.255.0::eth0:off
```

However systemd-networkd is configured to lease from DHCP or self-assign and should even be reachable by self assigned address if mDNS is available.

The cmdline.txt and authorized_keys (SSH) file live on separate partitions but both partitions are accessible from a Windows, MacOS, or Linux system. An SSH key 
is required for access and will need to be configured.

## TODO 
- OS boots, on QEMU and on a Raspi 3, this system needs to be put to the test and camera configuration is incomplete.
